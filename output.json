            "summary": "Artificial intelligence weather prediction (AIWP) models now often outperform traditional physics-based models on common metrics while requiring orders-of-magnitude less computing resources and time. Open-access AIWP models thus hold promise as transformational tools for helping low- and middle-income populations make decisions in the face of high-impact weather shocks. Yet, current approaches to evaluating AIWP models focus mainly on aggregated meteorological metrics without considering local stakeholders' needs in decision-oriented, operational frameworks."

            "summary": "Accurate and high-resolution estimation of land surface temperature (LST) is crucial in estimating evapotranspiration, a measure of plant water use and a central quantity in agricultural applications. In this work, we develop a novel statistical method for downscaling LST data obtained from NASA's ECOSTRESS mission, using high-resolution data from the Landsat 8 mission as a proxy for modeling agricultural field structure. Using the Landsat data, we identify the boundaries of agricultural fields through edge detection techniques, allowing us to capture the inherent block structure present in the spatial domain."

            "summary": "Large language models show promise for knowledge-intensive domains, yet their use in agriculture is constrained by weak grounding, English-centric training data, and limited real-world evaluation. These issues are amplified for low-resource languages, where high-quality domain documentation exists but remains difficult to access through general-purpose models. This paper presents AgriHubi, a domain-adapted retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system for Finnish-language agricultural decision support."
